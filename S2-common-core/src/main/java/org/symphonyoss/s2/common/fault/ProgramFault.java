/**
 * A ProgramFault should be thrown when an error occurs which is so
 * severe that the entire program (JVM) should be terminated. An immediate
 * restart of the process should NOT generally be attempted. The subclass
 * TransientProgramFault can be thrown to indicate a failure mode where an
 * immediate restart may be successful.
 * 
 * Note that this exception does not, of itself, cause termination of the
 * JVM but the fault barrier catching it should cause that to happen.
 * This may be through an abrupt or graceful termination of the application.
 * 
 * This exception should NOT be used to wrap subclasses of java.lang.Error,
 * such errors should be allowed to unwind the stack and terminate the 
 * JVM normally.
